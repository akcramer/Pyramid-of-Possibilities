Simulation0 
========================

This is my first attempt at getting an openGL simulation working for the Pyramid of Possibilities. When looking at the code, keep in mind that I knew nothing about how to write openGL code a few months ago.

At the moment, the LED lights are just fixed. At some point, we'll actually be incorporating LED lighting control code into the simulator.

Much of the code is adapted from various openGL tutorials/sample code. 

There are some simple controls for the simulator:

## Keyboard controls

* u - view from above
* b - view from below
* f - view from front
* r - start/stop object rotation
* 0 - reset view

## Mouse controls

* drag - rotate camera
* scroll wheel - zoom; change camera aperture
* drag right mouse - pan camera; move camera up/down/left/right
* drag other mouse - dolly camera; move camera in/out
