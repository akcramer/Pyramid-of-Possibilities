Pyramid-of-Possibilities
========================

For the Pyramid of Possibilities project for Burning Man

## Sketches


* BasicTestOctoWS2811 - test code that comes with the OctoWS2811 libraries
* DutyCycle - test visible apprence of different refresh rates (at at 50% duty cycle)
* MMA8452Test - basic test code for MMA8452
* PP0 - PoP platform code with rotating dots
* PP1 - PoP platform code with comets
* Rainbow - test code using OctoWS2811  
* RefreshTest - tests how fast we can refresh strip using Adafruit library
* chaser - initial test code for RNChaser

## Radical Norm Libraries

 * Accelerometer - Accelerometer code
 * RNLights - Light code, provides functionality not provided by OctoWS2811 or NeoPixel, offers a portable abstraction layer
 * RNChaser - Chaser/Comet code
 * printf - provides printf functionality
 
## Standard libraries
* FastLED - primarily used for hsv2rgb_rainbow
* NeoPixel 
* OctoWS2811 
* i2c_t3 - wire library
